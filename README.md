# Questions About Node JS

#### üîπ What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which is used by Google Chrome and other web browsers. Node.js is used for building server-side applications, APIs, and real-time web applications.

#### üöÄ Key Features

- Asynchronous & Event-Driven: Non-blocking architecture handles multiple requests simultaneously.

- Single-threaded but Scalable: Uses an event loop for handling concurrent operations efficiently.

- Built-in Libraries: Offers core modules (like `http`, `fs`, `path`) to handle server, file, and network operations.

- NPM (Node Package Manager): Comes with the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Installing Node.js

you can install `Node.js` from the official website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

To verify installation :

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### üí° Basic Example :

Simple HTTP server written in Node.js :

```javascript
// hello.js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000');
});
```

Run it using :

```bash
node hello.js
```

#### üì¶ Using NPM Modules

You can install and use external libraries via `npm`.

Example : Create a simple web server using `Express`.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Express server running at http://localhost:3000');
});
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Common Use Cases

- Building RESTful APIs

- Real-time applications (e.g., chats with Socket.IO)

- File handling scripts

- Automation tools and CLI apps

- Microservices and serverless apps


#### ‚ùìWhy is NodeJS single-threaded ?

NodeJS is single-threaded because it's based on the asynchronous, non-blocking nature of JavaScript. This design makes it simpler to develop and maintain, and it allows NodeJS to handle many concurrent requests efficiently.

#### ‚ùìIf NodeJS is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?

NodeJS uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle concurrency. It uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations and manage the execution of code. This allows NodeJS to handle multiple concurrent requests without blocking the event loop, which improves performance and responsiveness.

#### ‚ùìHow does NodeJS handle I/O operations?

NodeJS uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle I/O operations. It uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations and manage the execution of code. This allows NodeJS to handle many concurrent I/O operations efficiently without blocking the event loop.

#### ‚ùìWhy is NodeJS preferred over other backend technologies like Java and PHP?

Here are some reasons why NodeJS is preferred:

- **Fast Performance**: NodeJS is known for its speed in handling I/O-heavy tasks.
- **NPM Ecosystem**: Node Package Manager offers over 50,000 bundles to help developers speed up development.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Perfect for data-intensive, real-time apps as it doesn't wait for APIs to return data.
- **Unified Codebase**: The Same code is used for both server and client, improving synchronization.
- **Easy for JavaScript Developers**: Since NodeJS is based on JavaScript, web developers can easily integrate it into their projects.
- **Cross-Platform**: NodeJS can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Easy Deployment**: NodeJS is easy to deploy and maintain, making it a popular choice for web development.
